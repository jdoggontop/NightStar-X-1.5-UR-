NightStar X was a powerful Roblox exploit known for its midrange DLL integration, intuitive SimpleUI, and built-in Script Hub. Although no longer in development, it was celebrated for its innovative design and user-friendly features, making script execution easy and efficient.

Nightstar is no longer in development due to Roblox inlining core functions, which caused the exploit to slowly break over time.
